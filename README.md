# ChapterChat-Bot
A chatbot project that employs a Gemini Gem to contribute to a more dicussion based, exploratory chatbot.

# Instructions
The intention of ChapterChat is to allow deeper exploration of a text that a student may have to read for a high school course. Users should employ ChapterChat when a particular text or passage proves confusing or interesting, as the chatbot will respond with questions to further a student's critical thinking.

# Version
Gemini Gem only allows the chatbot to be trained on ten files, limiting the work this specific bot could be trained on at the moment.
This version of ChapterChat is trained on the following novels and their related analyses and reviews:
    Dracula (Bram Stoker)
    Frankenstein (Mary Shelley)
    Great Expectations (Charles Dickens)
    The Great Gatsby (F. Scott Fitzgerald)
    Romeo and Juliet (Shakespeare)
